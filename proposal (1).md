# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Try-On Mall

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game in Roblox that allows users to display their clothes and sell them. It would also allow users to try on the clothes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will start with building the mall in Roblox studio. Once the general experience is built, additional elements that require programming will be added, including:
- a program for trying on the clothes
- a program for buying the clothes where the profit would go to the creator of the designs
- a program that allows users to donate in-game currency to the owner of the game
- a program to run music in the background
- a program that gives an achievement     for finding a hidden area
- a program that allows users to buy their own store that lasts for a pre-determined amount of time (this will either be 24 hours, or there will be different tiers for different amounts of time)

I would also like to implement a system that stores each user's data for when they return and displays it for all the users in the server to see as a ranking system, eg: how many hours each user has been in the experience, how many items each user has bought in the experience, etc.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The users will be able to enter the game, explore the area, and try on clothes that were pre-loaded into the game as well as buy them.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1) Users can also donate to the game via an in-game donation board. The board will display who the top donors are
2) There will be free music playing in the background that loops through different songs.
3) An in-game achievement will be given to those who find a hidden room.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1) Users can upload their own designs into the game and other users can try them on and buy them. The profits from the design will go directly to the user who uploaded them.
2) Users who have joined my group will get an in-game header that shows their rank. Other users will be able to see it. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I will need to build the experience in Roblox studio. I can do most of the work within Roblox studio, but to add certain objects I might need to use blender to create them. After that I will begin familiarizing myself with Lua, which is the language the engine uses. I can do this by looking up tutorials and searching through the roblox devforum. Then I will be able to begin the programming step of the project.
