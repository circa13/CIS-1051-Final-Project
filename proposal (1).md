The users will be able to enter the game, explore the area, and try on clothes that were pre-loaded into the game as well as buy them.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1) Users can also donate to my group via an in-game donation board. The board will display who the top donors are. 2) There will be free music playing in the background that loops through different songs continuously. 3) An in-game achievement will be given to those who find a hidden room.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1) Users can upload their own designs into the game and other users can try them on and buy them. The profits from the design will go directly to the user who uploaded them. 2) Users who have joined my group will get an in-game header that shows their rank. Other users will be able to see it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
